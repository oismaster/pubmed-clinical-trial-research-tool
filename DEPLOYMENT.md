# Distribution Options for PubMed Clinical Trial Research Tool v1.0

## Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended for Colleagues)

The easiest way to share with colleagues:
1. Click the "Deploy" button in your Replit interface
2. Share the generated `.replit.app` URL with colleagues
3. They can access immediately without any setup
4. You'll need to provide them with an OpenAI API key or configure it in the deployment

## Option 2: Source Code Distribution

For colleagues who want to run it locally:

### Package Contents
- Complete TypeScript/JavaScript source code
- React frontend with Tailwind CSS styling
- Express.js backend server
- All configuration files
- Installation instructions

### What Your Colleagues Need
1. Node.js 18 or higher installed
2. An OpenAI API key
3. Basic command line familiarity

### Installation Steps for Recipients
1. Extract the `.tar.gz` file
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create `.env` file with their OpenAI API key
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
5. Open http://localhost:5000

## Option 3: Docker Distribution (Advanced)

For standardized deployment across different systems, you could also package this as a Docker container, though that would require additional setup.

## File Format
The application is distributed as:
- **Source code**: `.tar.gz` archive containing all TypeScript/JavaScript files
- **Live deployment**: Web application accessible via URL

## OpenAI API Key Requirement
Your colleagues will need their own OpenAI API keys to use the AI extraction features. The application will not function without this credential.
